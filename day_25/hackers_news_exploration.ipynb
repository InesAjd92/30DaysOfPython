    "\n",
    "In this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we aim to investigate the factors that drive engagement and rivalry on Hacker News posts. Specifically, we will explore the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What elements contribute to the rivalry around a post, as measured by points and number of comments?  \n",
    "- Are there certain types of influencers (authors) who consistently receive more points or comments?  \n",
    "- Do specific topics or themes in post titles attract higher engagement?  \n",
    "- How has the volume of posts evolved over time since the platform's launch?\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these questions, we formulate the following hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Posts with higher points tend to generate more comments, indicating greater rivalry and engagement.  \n",
    "- Some authors, acting as influencers, consistently receive more attention in terms of points and comments.  \n",
    "- Certain topics or keywords in titles are more likely to attract higher engagement.  \n",
    "- The number of posts has increased over time, reflecting the growth of the Hacker News community.\n",

    "- **October 2015** featured major security alerts such as the Adobe Flash vulnerability and lightweight web frameworks for low-resource systems.\n",
    "- **November 2015** included discussions on corporate reorganizations, critiques of Apple’s design, and intriguing tech stories.\n",
    "- **January 2016** highlighted debates on Apple’s competitive edge, Bitcoin’s future, and cybersecurity concerns like OpenSSH.\n",
    "- **March 2016** brought attention to high-profile cyberattacks (DDoS), scientific reproducibility, Tesla firmware hacks, and socio-economic ideas like universal basic income.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this exploratory data analysis of the Hacker News dataset, we investigated the key factors driving engagement and rivalry on the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "We found that the distribution of both points and number of comments is highly skewed, with most posts receiving relatively low engagement while a small subset of viral posts attract disproportionate attention. Using the 95th percentile thresholds, we identified approximately 1,382 viral posts that stand out in terms of points or comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "A strong positive correlation (~0.78) between points and comments confirms that posts garnering more votes tend to also generate more discussion, although exceptions highlight varied user interaction patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of top authors with viral posts revealed that a few influential contributors consistently produce highly engaging content, supporting the hypothesis of identifiable influencers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining viral post titles showed a dominance of major technology brands and thematic keywords related to software development, open source, and emerging tech trends, indicating that content centered on these topics drives significant engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the temporal analysis of post volumes uncovered distinct peaks corresponding to major tech events, security vulnerabilities, and socio-economic discussions, demonstrating how external factors influence user activity and rivalry on Hacker News.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these findings reveal patterns and relationships consistent with our initial hypotheses, providing valuable insights into the factors that influence popularity and engagement on Hacker News.  \n"
